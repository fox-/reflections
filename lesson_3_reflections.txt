<!-- Working with GitHub -->

[git remote]
Adds empty remote space? for adding remote repositories there.

[git remote add <name_of_remote> <link_to_remote>]
This command is used to add a remote repository. <name_of_remote> can be any
name but usually (if you have only 1 remote repository for your local one
you wanna use name <origin>?).

[git remote -v]
Shows remotes for current repository and corresponding links to fetch from
and push to data.

[git push <name_of_the_remote> <name_of_local_branch>]
[git push origin master]
This command sends changes to the remote repository earlier created for
the local repository. It also needs to specify a local branch to send
changes from. Thus, all commits reachable from the specified branch will
be sent to GitHub.

[git pull <name_of_remote> <name_of_branch>]
[git pull origin master]
This command allows to suck in changes made in local repository by me
or someone else from other computer or from the GitHub website directly.

[git fetch <name_of_remote>]
[git fetch origin]
This command allows to pull changes made by other people on the GitHub
without discarding any changes made locally by you. Basically by creating
new branch for changes that you fetch from the remote. More precisely
this command updates snapshot of the remote repository.

Then what is left is an unbearable mess with branches,
