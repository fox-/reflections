[git remote]
Adds empty remote space? for adding remote repositories there.

[git remote add <name_of_remote> <link_to_remote>]
This command is used to add a remote repository. <name_of_remote> can be any
name but usually (if you have only 1 remote repository for your local one
you wanna use name <origin>?).

[git remote -v]
Shows remotes for current repository and corresponding links to fetch from
and push to data.

[git push <name_of_the_remote> <name_of_local_branch>]
[git push origin master]
This command sends changes to the remote repository earlier created for
the local repository. It also needs to specify a local branch to send
changes from. Thus, all commits reachable from the specified branch will
be sent to GitHub.

[git pull <name_of_remote> <name_of_branch>]
[git pull origin master]
This command allows to suck in changes made in local repository by me
or someone else from other computer or from the GitHub website directly.
