[git remote]
Adds empty remote space? for adding remote repositories there.

[git remote add <name_of_remote> <link_to_remote>]
This command is used to add a remote repository. <name_of_remote> can be any
name but usually (if you have only 1 remote repository for your local one
you wanna use name <origin>?).
